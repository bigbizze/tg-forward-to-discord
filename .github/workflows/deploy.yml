# GitHub Actions Deployment Workflow
#
# This workflow deploys the application to a remote server when code is pushed
# to the master branch. It SSHs into the server and runs the idempotent setup
# script.
#
# Required Secrets (configure in GitHub repo settings):
# - SSH_HOST: Server IP address or hostname
# - SSH_USER: SSH username (e.g., ubuntu)
# - SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: SSH private key for authentication
# - SSH_PORT: SSH port (optional, defaults to 22)
#
# The server should have:
# - The repository cloned at ~/tg-discord (or adjust the path below)
# - SSH access configured with the provided key
# - sudo access for package installation (first run only)
